# flybu-hangman
##### Flybu's hangman project!

Simple hangman iOS app to practice programming in Swift while using xcode. As of right now the app is very featureless, but more features will (hopefully) be added as we learn more about developing apps in xcode! See below for a list of features and planned features. 

## Current Features
- Play a simple game of hangman
- Only one word to guess, word can be changed in code
- Authentic hangman drawing featuring the gallows and the hangman
- Poorly scaled keyboard in alphabetic order
- Motivational text that responds to whether you get a letter right or not
- Win/Loss detection (game doesn't go on forever)
- Randomly chosen word from a pre-set dictionary
- Start/Reset a game 

## Planned Features
- Different tiers of difficulties
- Code comments (my bad)
- A more detailed, realistic hangman (aka adding a face)
- Better UI scaling and positioning
- Main Menu
